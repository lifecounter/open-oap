# open-oap - open application platform

Development project for an open-source TYPO3 extension.

## Partners
- GIZ funding programmes develoPPP and BACKUP Health (www.giz.de, www.develoPPP.de, www.giz.de/en/worldwide/39036.html)
- cosmoblonde GmbH - we are a Berlin based TYPO3 agency (www.cosmoblonde.de)
- EDELWEISS72 GmbH - a Munich based full-service agency (www.edelweiss72.de)

## Typo3-Version
The current supportet version is 11, in July 2024 it will be updated to 12.

## Note
Sorry, there was a misleading note in version 1.2.0 (an old one from 1.1)
With version 1.2 we are completely independent of further own extensions - everything is freely accessible and installable with composer.
